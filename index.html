      <p>The head trainer and manager of Bittersweet Farm, Kristen fell in love
        with horses and riding as a young child, and spent the next several
        years eventing and advancing through the levels of Pony Club. In 2008
        she became the second person in the country to receive their Dressage A
        rating. Over the years, she rode and trained a number of challenging and
        unlikely horses to successful show careers, each of which taught her a
        great deal about horsemanship, riding, and life. Kristen’s focused
        career in dressage started in 2006, when her mother purchased a
        6-year-old Paint horse and was further facilitated by her partnership
        with Diwandre, a mature schoolmistress, in 2008. Kristen has since
        competed to Intermediare I with Diwandre and has trained Jester from
        training level to schooling Grand Prix. During this time, Kristen earned
        her USDF Bronze and Silver medals. </p>



      <p> In December 2010, Kristen graduated from the University of New
        Hampshire with a B.S. in Business Administration with a focus in
        Marketing and Entrepreneurship, and a B.A. in Journalism. While in
        school, Kristen balanced her academic commitments with training multiple
        horses, managing the small family farm, and volunteering as an EMT.
        Kristen has won several year-end awards and in 2009, Kristen was honored
        to receive the Dressage Foundation’s Amanda Ward Scholarship Award in
        addition to winning the Region 8 Young Rider Championships. </p>

      <p> In 2010, Kristen was invited to participate in The Dressage
        Foundation's Olympic Dream Program for advanced young riders to further
        their education in a comprehensive training trip to Germany. Her journal
        of the experience can be read here.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I love riding not only for the challenge...</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>"I love riding not only for the challenge of training and the
        thrill of competitive success, but for the unique relationships I
        develop
        with my horses. I take enjoyment in seeing their personalities develop
        along with their training, and knowing that they appreciate seeing me,
        nearly as much as I do them"</p>

      <p>Kristen moved to Florida in January of 2011 to train young horses for
        Horses Unlimited and ride their stallion Pik L, and continued on to work
        for Danish international dressage rider Mikala Gundersen as an assistant
        trainer and barn manager in Wellington.</p>

      <p>In the spring of 2015, Kristen traveled to the Netherlands with her top
        horse, Stella, to advance their training with international trainer Rien
        van der Schaft at his farm. In June of 2016, Kristen returned to start
        the Doctorate of Physical Therapy program at the University of Vermont.
        She continued to return to Holland to advance her and Stella's training
        between semesters for a year. Kristen maintains full training of 2-3
        horses while in Vermont, and returns regularly to New Hampshire to
        conduct clinics. </p>

      <p>Kristen looks forward to continuing to train horses with the goal of
        competing in the national young horse championships, developing horse
        divisions, and at Grand Prix.</p>
